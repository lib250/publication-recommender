            " [\"Intelligent information retrieval (IIR) requires inference. The number of inferences that can be drawn by even a simple reasoner is very large, and the inferential resources available to any practical computer system are limited. This problem is one long faced by AI researchers. In this paper, we present a method used by two recent machine learning programs for control of inference that is relevant to the design of IIR systems. The key feature of the approach is the use of explicit representations of desired knowledge, which we call knowledge goals. Our theory addresses the representation of knowledge goals, methods for generating and transforming these goals, and heuristics for selecting among potential inferences in order to feasibly satisfy such goals. In this view, IIR becomes a kind of planning: decisions about what to infer, how to infer and when to infer are based on representations of desired knowledge, as well as internal representations of the system's inferential abilities and current state. The theory is illustrated using two case studies, a natural language understanding program that learns by reading novel newspaper stories, and a differential diagnosis program that improves its accuracy with experience. We conclude by making several suggestions on how this machine learning framework can be integrated with existing information retrieval methods.\"\n",
            " 'A read-once formula is one in which each variable appears on at most a single input. Angluin, Hellerstein, and Karpinski give a polynomial time algorithm that uses membership and equivalence queries to identify exactly read-once boolean formulas over the basis fAND; OR; NOTg [AHK93]. The goal of this work is to consider natural generalizations of these gates, in order to develop exact identification algorithms for more powerful classes of formulas. We show that read-once formulas over a basis of arbitrary boolean functions of constant fan-in k or less (i.e. any f : f0; 1g 1ck ! f0; 1g) are exactly identifiable in polynomial time using membership and equivalence queries. We show that read-once formulas over the basis of arbitrary symmetric boolean functions are also exactly identifiable in polynomial time in this model. Given standard cryptographic assumptions, there is no polynomial time identification algorithm for read-twice formulas over either of these bases using membership and equivalence queries. We further show that for any basis class B meeting certain technical conditions, any polynomial time identification algorithm for read-once formulas over B can be extended to a polynomial time identification algorithm for read-once formulas over the union of B and the arbitrary functions of fan-in k or less. As a result, read-once formulas over the union of arbitrary symmetric and arbitrary constant fan-in gates are also exactly identifiable in polynomial time using membership and equivalence queries.'\n",
            " 'It is well known that prior knowledge or bias can speed up learning, at least in theory. It has proved difficult to make constructive use of prior knowledge, so that approximately correct hypotheses can be learned efficiently. In this paper, we consider a particular form of bias which consists of a set of \"determinations.\" A set of attributes is said to determine a given attribute if the latter is purely a function of the former. The bias is tree-structured if there is a tree of attributes such that the attribute at any node is determined by its children, where the leaves correspond to input attributes and the root corresponds to the target attribute for the learning problem. The set of allowed functions at each node is called the basis. The tree-structured bias restricts the target functions to those representable by a read-once formula (a Boolean formula in which each variable occurs at most once) of a given structure over the basis functions. We show that efficient learning using a given tree-structured bias from random examples and membership queries is possible if the basis class itself is learnable and obeys some mild closure conditions. The algorithm uses a form of controlled experimentation in order to learn each part of the overall function, fixing the inputs to the other parts of the function at appropriate values. We present empirical results that demonstrate that when a tree-structured bias is available, our method significantly improves upon knowledge-free induction. We also show that there are hard cryptographic limitations'\n",

              "'One of the persistent themes in Artificial Life research is the use of co-evolutionary arms races in the development of specific and complex behaviors. However, other than Simss work on artificial robots, most of the work has attacked very simple games of prisoners dilemma or predator and prey. Following Tesauros work on TD-Gammon, we used a 4000 parameter feed-forward neural network to develop a competitive backgammon evaluation function. Play proceeds by a roll of the dice, application of the network to all legal moves, and choosing the move with the highest evaluation. However, no back-propagation, reinforcement or temporal difference learning methods were employed. Instead we apply simple hill-climbing in a relative fitness environment. We start with an initial champion of all zero weights and proceed simply by playing the current champion network against a slightly mutated challenger, changing weights when the challenger wins. Our results show co-evolution to be a powerful machine learning method, even when coupled with simple hill-climbing, and suggest that the surprising success of Tesauros program had more to do with the co-evolutionary structure of the learning task and the dynamics of the backgammon game itself, than to sophistication in the learning techniques. Michie initiated machine learning work on reinforcement with his MENACE tic-tac-toe learner using matchboxes with the positions drawn on them (Michie, 1961). However such self-organizing systems had generally been fraught with problems of scale and representation and abandoned by the field of AI. Self-playing game learners often learn weird and brittle strategies which allow them to draw each other, yet play poorly against humans and other programs. Yet after millions of iterations of self-play, Tesauros program has become one of the best backgammon players in the world (Tesauro, 1995) and his weights are viewed by his corporation as significant enough intellectual property to keep as a trade secret except to leverage sales of their minority operating system. (International Business Machines, 1995). However, Tesauro has published the weights for a player using a linear evaluation function called PUBEVAL, which we made use of as a yardstick. Others have replicated this TD result both for research purposes (Boyan, 1992) and reportedly in a commercial product called Jellyfish. How is this success to be understood, explained, and replicated in other domains? Is TD-Gammon unbridled good news about the reinforcement learning method? For the idea of conditioning a machine with rewards and punishments has been rejected by modern cognitive science as part of the associationist paradigm based on its weak or non-existent internal representations. It has been brought back to life in modern machine learning form through work initiated by Klopf, 1982, Barto et al., 1983, and Sutton, 1984. Similarly, there is a lot of work in learning in neural networks following the explosive success of BackPropagation at overcoming some limitations of the Perceptron(Rumelhart et al., 1986). However, with respect to the goal of a self-organizing learning machine which starts from a minimal specification and rises to great sophistication, TD-Gammon stands quite alone in both the reinforcement and neural network literature.'"

            "Our theoretical understanding of the properties of genetic algorithms (GAs) being used for function optimization (GAFOs) is not as strong as we would like. Traditional schema analysis provides some first order insights, but doesn't capture the non-linear dynamics of the GA search process very well. Markov chain theory has been used primarily for steady state analysis of GAs. In this paper we explore the use of transient Markov chain analysis to model and understand the behavior of finite population GAFOs observed while in transition to steady states. This approach appears to provide new insights into the circumstances under which GAFOs will (will not) perform well. Some preliminary results are presented and an initial evaluation of the merits of this approach is provided.\n",

In that paper, the states of the Markov model were ordered via a simple and mathematically convenient lexicographic ordering used initially by Nix and Vose. In this paper, we explore alternative orderings of states based on interesting semantic properties such as average fitness, degree of homogeneity, average attractive force, etc. We also explore lumping techniques for reducing the size of the state space. Analysis of these reordered and lumped Markov models provides new insights into the transient behavior of GAs in general and GAFOs in particular.\n"

            "This paper discusses the problem of how to implement many-to-many, or multi-associative, mapping within connectionist models. Traditional symbolic approaches work through explicit representation of all alternatives via stored links, or implicitly through enumerative algorithms. Classical pattern association models ignore the issue of generating multiple outputs for a single input pattern, and while recent research on recurrent networks is promising, the field has not clearly focused upon multi-associativity as a goal. In this paper, we define multiassociative memory (MM), and several possible variants, and discuss its utility in general cognitive modeling. We extend sequential cascaded networks (Pollack 1987, 1990a) to fit the task, and perform several initial experiments which demonstrate the feasibility of the concept.\n",
            "Genetic algorithms have been used for neural networks in two main ways: to optimize the network architecture and to train the weights of a fixed architecture. While most previous work focuses on only one of these two options, this paper investigates an alternative evolutionary approach called Breeder Genetic Programming (BGP) in which the architecture and the weights are optimized simultaneously. The genotype of each network is represented as a tree whose depth and width are dynamically adapted to the particular application by specifically defined genetic operators. The weights are trained by a next-ascent hillclimbing search. A new fitness function is proposed that quantifies the principle of Occam's razor. It makes an optimal trade-off between the error fitting ability and the parsimony of the network. Simulation results on two benchmark problems of differing complexity suggest that the method finds minimal size networks on clean data. The experiments on noisy data show that using Occam's razor not only improves the generalization performance, it also accel erates the convergence speed of evolution. fl Published in Complex Systems, 7(3): 199-220, 1993\n",
            "We present a system that lets 3-D models evolve over time, eventually produce novel models that are more desirable than initial models. The algorithm starts with some crude models given by the user, or randomly-generated models from a given model-grammar with generic design rules and loose constraints. The underlying philosophy here is to gradually evolve the initial models into better models over many generations. There is a close analog in the evolution of species where better-fit species gradually emerge and form specialized niches, a highly efficient process of complex structural and functional optimization. Our simulation results for model jet plane designs illustrate that our approach to model design and refinement is both feasible and effective.\n"
