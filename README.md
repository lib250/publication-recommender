# DS 598 DL4DS Project - Academic Publication Recommender

The project aims to build a proof-of-concept recommender system for academic publications using graph neural networks.
More information can be found in the documents in the `documents` folder (more specifically the Mid-Project check-in [document](https://github.com/lib250/publication-recommender/blob/main/documents/2_Mid-Project_Check-in.pdf)). 

The Jupyter [notebook](https://github.com/lib250/publication-recommender/blob/main/midproject_checkin.ipynb) contains code progress up to the Mid-project Check-in milestone.
